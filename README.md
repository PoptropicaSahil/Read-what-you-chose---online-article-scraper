The script `salu.py` scrapes articles from a list of 
websites and allows users to chose if they want to read them
- If Yes is chosen, the articles open in the browser, else a new article is suggested
- To add your favourite website, simply edit the `website_list` list in `salu.py`


_I created this for my sister, who is a product manager and needs to read a ton of articles!_
